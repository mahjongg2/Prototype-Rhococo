# Prototype-Rhococo
Prototype of my Retro Home color computer

Here I commit CAD files, (main page is Rhococo.sch with sub-schematics Z80CPU+RAM.sch, and KEYBOARD.sch, and RHOCOCO.kicad.PCB for the layout) 
eventually I will also upload ideas, code and other stuff so that others can also build and test prototypes of my retro home computer.

Note that I explicitly call this a prototype, as Rhococo is still in development, and not a fully functioning device.
Lots of things are not even tested yet, as for testing them other stuff must work first.

if you want to discuss this meaterial with me, the best place for now would be here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=226889
