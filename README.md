# Prototype-Rhococo
Prototype of my Retro Home color computer

Here I commit CAD files, (main page is Rhococo.sch with sub-schematics Z80CPU+RAM.sch, and KEYBOARD.sch, and RHOCOCO.kicad.PCB for the layout) ideas, code and other stuff so that others can also build and test prototypes of my retro home computer.

Note that I explicitly call this a prototype, as Rhococo is still in development, and not a fully functioning device.
Lots of things are not even tested yet, as for testing them other stuff must work first.
